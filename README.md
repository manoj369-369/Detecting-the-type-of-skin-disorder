🏥 SKIN DISEASE CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING

📌 OVERVIEW

🚀 This project aims to classify different types of skin disorders using machine learning models. Early diagnosis can help doctors provide better treatment plans.

🩺 SKIN CONDITIONS & SYMPTOMS

🔍 Common Symptoms Analyzed:
✔️ Erythema – Redness of skin due to increased blood flow.✔️ Scaling – Flaky or peeling skin.✔️ Definite Borders – Clear, well-defined edges of lesions.✔️ Itching – Uncomfortable sensation causing the urge to scratch.✔️ Koebner Phenomenon – Skin lesions forming at trauma sites.✔️ Polygonal Papules – Small, raised, multi-sided bumps.✔️ Follicular Papules – Small bumps around hair follicles.

📂 DATASET

📊 Features Analyzed:
✔️ Categorical Features – Symptoms & skin conditions.
✔️ Numerical Features – Age, severity scores, and other medical attributes.
✔️ Class Distribution Analysis – Checked for dataset balance.

🔹 Preprocessing Techniques:
✔️ Handling missing values.
✔️ Feature engineering & transformation.
✔️ Normalization & scaling.
✔️ Train-test splitting.
