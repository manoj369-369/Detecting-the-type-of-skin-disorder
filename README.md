🏥 SKIN DISEASE CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING

📌 OVERVIEW

🚀 This project aims to classify different types of skin disorders using machine learning models. Early diagnosis can help doctors provide better treatment plans.

🫋 SKIN CONDITIONS & SYMPTOMS

🔍 Common Symptoms Analyzed:
✔️ Erythema – Redness of skin due to increased blood flow.✔️ Scaling – Flaky or peeling skin.✔️ Definite Borders – Clear, well-defined edges of lesions.✔️ Itching – Uncomfortable sensation causing the urge to scratch.✔️ Koebner Phenomenon – Skin lesions forming at trauma sites.✔️ Polygonal Papules – Small, raised, multi-sided bumps.✔️ Follicular Papules – Small bumps around hair follicles.

💂️ DATASET

📊 Features Analyzed:✔️ Categorical Features – Symptoms & skin conditions.✔️ Numerical Features – Age, severity scores, and other medical attributes.✔️ Class Distribution Analysis – Checked for dataset balance.

🔹 Preprocessing Techniques:✔️ Handling missing values.✔️ Feature engineering & transformation.✔️ Normalization & scaling.✔️ Train-test splitting.

⚡ MODELS USED & PERFORMANCE COMPARISON

🔹🔵 1️⃣ LOGISTIC REGRESSION

✔️ Simple and interpretable model.✔️ Works well for linearly separable data.🎯 Accuracy: 82%

🔹🟢 2️⃣ RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER

✔️ Ensemble learning with decision trees.✔️ Handles non-linearity and complex interactions.🎯 Accuracy: 88%

🔹🟡 3️⃣ SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)

✔️ Effective for high-dimensional spaces.✔️ Uses kernel trick for complex decision boundaries.🎯 Accuracy: 85%

🔹🔴 4️⃣ XGBOOST (BEST MODEL)

✔️ Gradient boosting approach.✔️ Handles missing values efficiently.🎯 Accuracy: 92% ✅ Best Performing Model!



📌 Key Takeaways:✅ XGBoost (92%) is the best-performing model.✅ Random Forest (88%) performed well with non-linear data.✅ SVM (85%) is effective but slower on larger datasets.✅ Logistic Regression (82%) is a good baseline model.


🎯 CONCLUSION

🚀 Machine learning enables early detection of skin diseases for timely intervention. XGBoost is the most effective model, achieving 92% accuracy.
